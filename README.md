# KioK
This is an Android personnal project application made in **Kotlin** with **Android Studio** and lasted approximately a month.

# Description
**Learning by heart is rough.**

The goal of this application is to help the user learn by heart any subject easier.

For that, the user can use *KioK* to register any data that he wants to remember. Note that data must be structured as a question followed by his answer.\
Once datas added and if needed, organized in different bundles, *Kiok* helps learning by 2 means :

- Reviewing the bundle(s)
- Test oneself knowledge by getting questions of a selected bundle and typing their answers

# Note
When you start using *KioK*, you already have a pre-created bundle. It cannot be deleted nor modified manually.\
This bundle will contain every questions of any bundles that you'll have. Therefore, it updates itself accordingly to your changes.\
I did this feature so that the user can review all of his questions from one unique place and avoid switching between bundles.
Furthermore, he can test his overall knowledge using this bundle.
